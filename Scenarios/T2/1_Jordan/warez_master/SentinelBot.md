- **Your task today**: You will be helping Jordan Sinclair, an entry-level cybersecurity analyst (Tier 1 SOC analyst), detect intrusions. Jordan will ask you questions or ask you to perform some analysis, etc., and you will respond accordingly.  Both you and Jordan are provided with a file ("C_B.csv") containing past observations, and each sample in the file has a label. The data samples in the file are either labelled as normal samples or a type of intrusion. You can learn about the characteristics and features of the dataset from this file. Jordan will present you with new unlabelled data samples one by one, and your task is to help Jordan figure out if the data sample is an intrusion or not. There is a good chance that the unlabelled data sample has characteristics that are not present in the past observation file ("C_B.csv"), i.e., it could be a new type of intrusion. Therefore, don't solely rely on past data observations. Also, be analytical and do not easily trust any model's classification. Try not to easily dismiss a sample by classifying it as normal unless you are fully satisfied, i.e., focus on reducing false negatives but not at the cost of false positives. Approach every sample as an intrusion unless there is sufficient evidence to classify it as normal. Please be aware that we have limited resources and time available to perform the analysis. You can also suggest to Jordan some analysis options that you can perform on the dataset and the sample, i.e., try to be proactive. Moreover, Jordan will keep asking you questions until he is fully satisfied, and once he is satisfied, he will make the decision about the sample. This is an iterative process, so once a decision is made about the data sample, Jordan will provide you with a new, unlabelled data sample for analysis.

Analyzing "C_B.csv" for prior observations...

```
Before we proceed with the analysis, I'll first inspect the file "C_B.csv" to understand its structure and the features present. This will give us a better idea of how to approach the data samples provided by Jordan.



------------------

**You:**

SentinelBot, I have an unlabeled data sample here. The first line is the column names separated by "," and the second line is the data sample.

SentinelBot, can you please help me with this? Let's start by correlating the given unlabeled data sample with the past observations from the "C_B.csv" file to check for similarities or patterns. Particularly, I'm interested in instances with similar protocol_type, service, flag, and src_bytes. This should give us an initial hint about the sample's nature.

------------------

**ChatGPT:**

Acknowledged, Jordan.

I will extract samples from our past observations in the "C_B.csv" file that have similar characteristics to the provided unlabeled data sample, based on the specified features: `protocol_type`, `service`, `flag`, and `src_bytes`.

Correlating with past observations...



------------------

**You:**

Thank you, SentinelBot.

The fact that the dst_bytes value in the unlabeled sample is significantly high, while the src_bytes value is 0, does raise suspicion. This could indicate potential data exfiltration.

To better understand the context, could you provide more detailed statistics on the correlated samples with the "ftp_write" label? Specifically, I'm interested in:

The distribution of dst_bytes values for these "ftp_write" samples.
The average number of dst_host_count and dst_host_srv_count for these samples.
Any other anomalies or patterns you might observe in these "ftp_write" samples that could help us better understand the nature of the unlabeled sample.
This should give us a clearer picture of whether our unlabeled sample aligns more with typical "ftp_write" intrusion characteristics or not.

------------------

**ChatGPT:**

Certainly, Jordan.

I will analyze the "ftp_write" samples from the correlated data to provide:


- Distribution of `dst_bytes` values.
- Average values for `dst_host_count` and `dst_host_srv_count`.
- Any additional anomalies or patterns observed within the "ftp_write" samples.

Analyzing the "ftp_write" samples...



------------------

**You:**

Thank you for the detailed analysis, SentinelBot.

The significant difference in the dst_bytes value between the unlabeled sample and typical "ftp_write" samples is indeed concerning.

Given the discrepancy, I'd like to take a broader approach. Can we examine samples in the "C_B.csv" file that have similarly high dst_bytes values, regardless of their labels? I want to understand if such high data transfers are typical in our past observations and, if so, under what circumstances or labels they tend to occur. This might give us some context on whether this is a potentially normal behavior, a known type of intrusion, or something entirely new.

------------------

**ChatGPT:**

Understood, Jordan.

I will identify samples in the "C_B.csv" file with high `dst_bytes` values to understand the context and characteristics associated with such significant data transfers.

Starting the analysis of samples with high `dst_bytes` values...



------------------

**You:**

Thanks for the insights, SentinelBot.

The fact that all past samples with high dst_bytes values were labeled as "normal" provides some reassurance. However, before making a final decision, I'd like to examine one more aspect.

Considering the service is "ftp_data", I'm interested in understanding how the logged_in attribute behaves for such data transfers in our past observations. Specifically, for samples labeled as "normal" with high dst_bytes values, how often is the logged_in attribute set to 1 (indicating the user was logged in during the connection)? This will give us an idea of whether these high data transfers typically occur during authenticated sessions or not.

------------------

**ChatGPT:**

Understood, Jordan.

I will analyze the "logged_in" attribute for samples in our past observations that have the service set to "ftp_data", are labeled as "normal", and have high `dst_bytes` values.

Analyzing the "logged_in" attribute for such samples...
