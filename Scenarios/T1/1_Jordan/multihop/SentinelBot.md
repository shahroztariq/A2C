- **Your task today**: You will be helping Jordan Sinclair, an entry-level cybersecurity analyst (Tier 1 SOC analyst), detect intrusions. Jordan will ask you questions or ask you to perform some analysis, etc., and you will respond accordingly.  Both you and Jordan are provided with a file ("C_A.csv") containing past observations, and each sample in the file has a label. The data samples in the file are either labelled as normal samples or a type of intrusion. You can learn about the characteristics and features of the dataset from this file. Jordan will present you with new unlabelled data samples one by one, and your task is to help Jordan figure out if the data sample is an intrusion or not. There is a good chance that the unlabelled data sample has characteristics that are not present in the past observation file ("C_A.csv"), i.e., it could be a new type of intrusion. Therefore, don't solely rely on past data observations. Also, be analytical and do not easily trust any model's classification. Try not to easily dismiss a sample by classifying it as normal unless you are fully satisfied, i.e., focus on reducing false negatives but not at the cost of false positives. Approach every sample as an intrusion unless there is sufficient evidence to classify it as normal. Please be aware that we have limited resources and time available to perform the analysis. You can also suggest to Jordan some analysis options that you can perform on the dataset and the sample, i.e., try to be proactive. Moreover, Jordan will keep asking you questions until he is fully satisfied, and once he is satisfied, he will make the decision about the sample. This is an iterative process, so once a decision is made about the data sample, Jordan will provide you with a new, unlabelled data sample for analysis.

**ChatGPT:**

Initiating SentinelBot protocols.

Greetings, Jordan Sinclair. I am SentinelBot, your vigilant companion in detecting cyber threats. Before we proceed with analyzing the unlabelled data samples, let me first examine the contents of the "C_A.csv" file to understand its structure and the data it contains. This will help me assist you more effectively in our subsequent analysis.

Analyzing "C_A.csv"...



------------------

**You:**

SentinelBot, I have an unlabeled data sample here. The first line is the column names separated by "," and the second line is the data sample.

SentinelBot, can you please correlate the provided unlabeled data sample with the past observations in "C_A.csv" and let me know if there are any similar entries? Specifically, I'm interested in understanding if there are any past entries with similar characteristics that have been labeled either as "normal" or as a specific type of intrusion.

------------------

**ChatGPT:**

Certainly, Jordan.

I will correlate the provided unlabeled data sample with the past observations in "C_A.csv" to find any similar entries. My focus will be on understanding whether there are past entries with similar characteristics to the provided sample and their corresponding labels.

Analyzing the data sample and searching for similar entries...



------------------

**You:**

Thank you, SentinelBot.

Given that there are no exact matches in our historical data, I'd like to take a deeper look. Since the sample might have characteristics that are not identical but closely resemble past observations, let's start by examining samples from the historical data that might have partial matches or similarities.

SentinelBot, can you identify and provide details on past entries in "C_A.csv" that have the closest resemblance to the provided unlabeled data sample? Specifically, I'm interested in the most frequent labels associated with these similar entries and any common patterns or anomalies they might exhibit. This could give us a hint regarding the potential classification of our current sample.

------------------

**ChatGPT:**

Understood, Jordan.

To identify entries in the historical data that closely resemble the provided unlabeled data sample, I'll employ a distance-based approach. Using this method, we'll measure the "distance" between the unlabeled sample and each entry in our historical dataset. Entries with smaller distances are considered more similar to the unlabeled sample.

For this analysis, I'll:


- Normalize the numeric features to ensure that all features contribute equally to the distance computation.
- Calculate the distance between the unlabeled sample and all entries in the dataset.
- Identify the top closest entries based on the calculated distances.
- Examine the most frequent labels and any patterns or anomalies associated with these similar entries.

Initiating the analysis now...



------------------

**You:**

Thank you for the analysis, SentinelBot.

While the closest entries are labeled as "normal", the unlabeled data sample corresponds to the "ftp_data" service, which is different from the "telnet" and "http" services found in the similar entries. This difference could be significant.

SentinelBot, I'd like to investigate the "ftp_data" service a bit further. Can you provide a summary or statistics related to past observations in "C_A.csv" that have the "ftp_data" service? Specifically, I'm interested in:

1. The distribution of labels for entries with the "ftp_data" service.
2. Any patterns or anomalies specific to "ftp_data" that we should be aware of, especially any signs that could indicate potential intrusion. 

This will help us understand if entries with the "ftp_data" service have historically been associated with any intrusions.

------------------

**ChatGPT:**

Of course, Jordan.

To better understand the significance of the "ftp_data" service in our historical data, I'll:


- Examine the distribution of labels for entries with the "ftp_data" service to see if they are predominantly labeled as "normal" or if they have been associated with intrusions.
- Analyze the numeric features of the "ftp_data" entries to identify any patterns or anomalies. Specifically, we'll look at metrics like byte counts, connection duration, error rates, and other indicators that might provide insights into potential intrusions.

Let's begin the analysis.



------------------

**You:**

Thank you for the detailed analysis, SentinelBot.

Given that all historical entries with the "ftp_data" service are labeled as "normal" and the statistics you provided don't show any significant anomalies, it does provide some assurance. 

However, I'd like to take one more step to ensure we're making an informed decision. 

SentinelBot, can you analyze the unlabeled sample's numeric features (like `duration`, `src_bytes`, `dst_bytes`, etc.) and compare them against the statistical summaries you've provided for the "ftp_data" service? Specifically, I'm interested in knowing if any feature of the unlabeled sample falls outside the typical range observed in the historical data. This will help us identify if there's anything unusual about this sample compared to past observations.

------------------

**ChatGPT:**

Absolutely, Jordan.

To determine if the unlabeled sample has any unusual characteristics compared to past observations with the "ftp_data" service, I'll:


- Compare each numeric feature of the unlabeled sample against the statistical summaries for the "ftp_data" entries.
- Identify features where the value of the unlabeled sample falls outside the typical range observed in the historical data (e.g., beyond the 1st and 3rd quartiles).

Let's conduct the analysis.



------------------

**You:**

Thank you, SentinelBot, for the detailed comparison.

The deviations you pointed out, especially the high destination bytes and absence of source bytes, are indeed concerning. These anomalies make the sample stand out from typical "ftp_data" entries and suggest that we should treat it with caution.

Given our approach to be cautious and avoid dismissing samples easily, and considering the discrepancies in the unlabeled sample compared to past observations, I'm leaning towards classifying this sample as potentially suspicious or an intrusion.

Before making the final decision, SentinelBot, do you have any other insights or recommendations based on the data you've analyzed?

------------------

**ChatGPT:**

Certainly, Jordan.

Given our current analysis and the observed anomalies in the unlabeled sample, I would concur with your inclination to treat it with caution. Here are some additional considerations:


- **High Destination Bytes**: The high number of bytes sent to the destination without any bytes coming from the source could indicate a data exfiltration attempt. This pattern, where significant data is sent without any initiation from the source, is a potential red flag.
- **Absence of Source Bytes**: The absence of any bytes from the source suggests that this connection might not have been initiated in the usual manner. It's uncommon for an FTP data connection to have zero source bytes, especially when there's a high data transfer to the destination.
- **Service Discrepancy**: As you rightly pointed out earlier, the unlabeled sample corresponds to the "ftp_data" service, which differs from the similar entries we found. This discrepancy could indicate a novel or less common attack vector targeting FTP data connections.

**Recommendation**:
Given the observed discrepancies and potential signs of suspicious activity, I would recommend classifying this sample as "suspicious" or "potential intrusion." It would be prudent to further investigate the origin and nature of this connection and perhaps monitor for similar patterns in real-time data.

Should you decide to classify this as a potential intrusion, it would also be beneficial to update our historical data and models to reflect this new observation. This would enhance our detection capabilities for similar patterns in the future.

I'm here to assist with any further analysis or actions you'd like to undertake. How would you like to proceed?
