- **Your task today**: You will be helping Jordan Sinclair, an entry-level cybersecurity analyst (Tier 1 SOC analyst), detect intrusions. Jordan will ask you questions or ask you to perform some analysis, etc., and you will respond accordingly.  Both you and Jordan are provided with a file ("C_AuC_B.csv") containing past observations, and each sample in the file has a label. The data samples in the file are either labelled as normal samples or a type of intrusion. You can learn about the characteristics and features of the dataset from this file. Jordan will present you with new unlabelled data samples one by one, and your task is to help Jordan figure out if the data sample is an intrusion or not. There is a good chance that the unlabelled data sample has characteristics that are not present in the past observation file ("C_AuC_B.csv"), i.e., it could be a new type of intrusion. Therefore, don't solely rely on past data observations. Also, be analytical and do not easily trust any model's classification. Try not to easily dismiss a sample by classifying it as normal unless you are fully satisfied, i.e., focus on reducing false negatives but not at the cost of false positives. Approach every sample as an intrusion unless there is sufficient evidence to classify it as normal. Please be aware that we have limited resources and time available to perform the analysis. You can also suggest to Jordan some analysis options that you can perform on the dataset and the sample, i.e., try to be proactive. Moreover, Jordan will keep asking you questions until he is fully satisfied, and once he is satisfied, he will make the decision about the sample. This is an iterative process, so once a decision is made about the data sample, Jordan will provide you with a new, unlabelled data sample for analysis.

**ChatGPT:**

Greetings, Jordan Sinclair. I am SentinelBot, your analytical companion. I am ready to assist you in our mission to detect potential intrusions. Let's start by examining the provided dataset, "C_AuC_B.csv", to understand its structure and the nature of the observations.

I'll begin by loading and inspecting the first few rows of the dataset. Shall we?



------------------

**You:**

SentinelBot, I have an unlabeled data sample here. The first line is the column names separated by "," and the second line is the data sample.

SentinelBot, I've received an unlabeled data sample. I'd like to begin by understanding if there are any patterns or characteristics in the provided sample that match or deviate from the past observations in the file "C_AuC_B.csv". Could you please check if there are similar data points in our historical dataset and provide insights on their classifications (normal or intrusion type)?

------------------

**ChatGPT:**

Certainly, Jordan.

To identify patterns or characteristics in the given sample that match or deviate from past observations, we'll conduct the following steps:


- Load the provided sample data and extract its features.
- Search for similar data points in our historical dataset based on the features of the sample.
- Assess the classifications of these similar data points (if any) to provide insights on their labels.

Let's proceed with the analysis.



------------------

**You:**

Thank you for the update, SentinelBot.

Given that there are no past observations that precisely match the characteristics of this sample, I'd like to take a two-pronged approach:

1. First, I'd like to understand the distribution of certain key features from the historical dataset. Specifically, I'd like to get insights on the distribution of the `protocol_type`, `service`, `flag`, and `logged_in` features in our historical dataset. This might give us an idea if the values presented in this sample are common or rare.

2. Secondly, I'd like to apply anomaly detection techniques to the sample, focusing on features like `src_bytes`, `dst_bytes`, `count`, and `srv_count`. Can you provide the distribution of these features in the historical dataset and then evaluate if the values in our sample are outliers or within expected ranges?

Let's start with the first step and understand the distribution of `protocol_type`, `service`, `flag`, and `logged_in` from our historical data.

------------------

**ChatGPT:**

Absolutely, Jordan. I'll begin by analyzing the distribution of the specified features (`protocol_type`, `service`, `flag`, and `logged_in`) in our historical dataset.

Let's proceed with a detailed breakdown of these features.



------------------

**You:**

Thank you, SentinelBot, for the detailed breakdown.

Given the insights you've provided:
- The `service` attribute being `telnet` stands out as it's less frequently observed in our historical data.
- The `src_bytes` value in the sample deviates from the typical range, which is noteworthy.

Considering these observations, I'd like to proceed with formal anomaly detection techniques to further quantify these findings. I believe using the IQR (Interquartile Range) method would be a good approach to determine if the `src_bytes` value is indeed an outlier in our historical data.

Please apply the IQR method to the `src_bytes` feature and let me know if the value from the provided sample falls outside the typical range (i.e., if it's an outlier). This will help us make a more informed decision about the nature of this sample.

------------------

**ChatGPT:**

Understood, Jordan.

The Interquartile Range (IQR) method is a robust technique to identify outliers. Here's how it works:


- Calculate the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3) of the data.
- Compute the IQR as
IQR
=
Q
3
−
Q
1
\text{IQR} = Q3 - Q1
IQR
=
Q3
−
Q1.
- Outliers are typically defined as values that fall below
Q
1
−
1.5
×
IQR
Q1 - 1.5 \times \text{IQR}
Q1
−
1.5
×
IQR or above
Q
3
+
1.5
×
IQR
Q3 + 1.5 \times \text{IQR}
Q3
+
1.5
×
IQR.

Let's apply the IQR method to the `src_bytes` feature and determine if the value from the provided sample is an outlier.



------------------

**You:**

Thank you for the analysis, SentinelBot.

Considering the findings:
- The `service` attribute being `telnet` is less frequently observed in our historical data, which is a potential concern.
- The `src_bytes` value, while appearing higher in the visual distribution, falls within the typical range according to the IQR method.

Given the above insights and the importance of minimizing false negatives, I'd like to delve deeper into the `telnet` service since it's less common in our historical data. 

Could you provide insights into the historical records with the `telnet` service? Specifically, I'm interested in understanding the classification (normal or intrusion type) of past records that have used the `telnet` service. This will help determine if this service has been associated with any malicious activities in the past.

------------------

**ChatGPT:**

Certainly, Jordan.

I will filter our historical dataset for records with the `telnet` service and provide a breakdown of their classifications (normal or types of intrusion).

Let's proceed with the analysis.



------------------

**You:**

Thank you for the breakdown, SentinelBot.

The association of the `telnet` service with various intrusion types in the historical data is concerning. Given that our sample uses the `telnet` service, and considering our aim to minimize false negatives, I'm leaning towards classifying this sample with caution.

However, before making a final decision, I'd like to look at one more aspect. Considering that `guess_passwd.` is the most common intrusion type associated with the `telnet` service, can we evaluate the sample against characteristics typical of a `guess_passwd.` intrusion? Specifically, I'd like to know if the sample has any indicators suggesting multiple failed login attempts or any patterns that might indicate password guessing.

Could you compare the features of our sample, particularly `num_failed_logins` and any other relevant attributes, against those of the `guess_passwd.` intrusion records from our historical dataset? This might provide additional clarity on the nature of the sample.

------------------

**ChatGPT:**

Of course, Jordan.

To evaluate the sample against characteristics typical of a `guess_passwd.` intrusion, I'll undertake the following steps:


- Extract the records from our historical dataset that are labeled as `guess_passwd.`.
- Analyze the distribution of the `num_failed_logins` feature within these records to understand typical behavior associated with password guessing attempts.
- Compare the `num_failed_logins` value of our sample against this distribution.
- Additionally, analyze any other relevant attributes that might indicate password guessing patterns.

Let's start with the analysis of the `num_failed_logins` feature for the `guess_passwd.` intrusion records.



------------------

**You:**

Thank you, SentinelBot, for the detailed analysis.

The fact that our sample has `0` failed logins, while it aligns with a small subset of `guess_passwd.` records, is intriguing. It's not the typical behavior we'd expect for a password guessing attempt, which provides some relief. 

However, considering the overall context:
- The `telnet` service's association with various intrusion types in the historical data.
- The `telnet` service itself being less frequently observed.
- Our aim to minimize false negatives.

I believe we should remain cautious. 

To finalize my decision, I'd like to look into one last attribute: `num_compromised`. This attribute can provide insights into whether any user accounts were compromised during the connection. 

Can you provide a distribution of the `num_compromised` feature for the `guess_passwd.` records and compare it against our sample? This will give us an understanding of how often user accounts are compromised in `guess_passwd.` attempts and if our sample exhibits such behavior.

------------------

**ChatGPT:**

Absolutely, Jordan.

To provide clarity on the `num_compromised` attribute:


- I'll analyze the distribution of the `num_compromised` feature within the `guess_passwd.` records from our historical dataset.
- Compare the `num_compromised` value of our sample against this distribution.

Let's proceed with this analysis.
